# Explanation
In this project, we utilize the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to perform face detection and apply blurring to the detected faces in real-time. OpenCV provides us with powerful computer vision functionalities, including face detection, while MediaPipe offers pre-trained models for face detection and facial landmark detection. By combining these libraries, we can accurately detect faces in an input video stream or image, and then apply a blur effect to those faces. This project enables us to enhance privacy or anonymize individuals in videos or images by automatically obscuring their faces with blurring, making it useful for various applications such as privacy protection, video editing, or identity concealment.
